# WhoAmI
Hello, I am **Shusan Adhikari** currently studying Information Technology at Informatic College Pokhara affiliated under London Metropolitian University. I was never a brilliant student but I am working my way out and trying my best to learn everything I can. I really have nothing special to say about myself but I hope that changes very soon in future. Till then, **grind goes on**. ;)

# About this Project
This is the **Final Year Project** of my college which is assigned to every students at the end of the third year. Every student are required to chose a topic on what they want to work on but I happen to copy the proposal from a random article I found in the Internet. To be honest, I really had no idea of what I chose but when I did, I had a regret but as always I had my friends to back me up. Now, I am really enjoying doing this project and I also hope that I can learn many things doing this project. I still have a long to go but this is the first project I am really doing although I am already at the final year of my college. Yeah, that's me. **A lazy boner**. But I hope to change this with this project. Wish me luck.
This project is all about creating a suitable timetable for the users as per their current location and their destination location by analyzing the time required to complete the task. I know **it's a mess but this is what I bought up to myself** and there is nowhere I can run from it.
